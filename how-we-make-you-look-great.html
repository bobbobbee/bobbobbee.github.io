Here's how we make the magic happen:</p><p>First and foremost, for those seeking a cost-effective route, we harness the power of GitHub as a hosting platform. This offers the dual advantage of free hosting paired with the reliability and speed that comes with a platform as esteemed as GitHub. However, recognizing that some clients prefer a more hands-off hosting experience, we also provide our own hosting services. While this comes at a minor fee, it promises a seamless, hassle-free hosting experience tailored to your unique requirements.</p><p>When it comes to crafting your website, static websites have emerged as a beacon of simplicity and speed. We are adept at implementing them through platforms like Publii, which offers a user-friendly interface for those unfamiliar with the intricacies of web development. Additionally, for those inclined towards more dynamic content without the complexities of traditional databases, we deploy flatfile CMS engines, such as Grav and Bludit. These engines allow for a harmonious blend of flexibility, ease of use, and performance.</p><p>Navigating the domain realm can be daunting, but with our guidance, you'll have a domain name that resonates with your organization's ethos and mission in no time. We'll not only help you select it but also ensure it's set up and running seamlessly. And if crafting compelling website copy feels like a challenge, our skilled team is at your service, ready to articulate your message with precision and flair.</p><p>Lastly, we firmly believe in the principle of data ownership. In an age dominated by tech behemoths, it's easy to feel dwarfed and lose control over one's own message. We champion the idea that every organization, no matter its size, should own its data and narrative. Relying solely on platforms like Facebook is akin to building a house on rented land. Every organization needs a dedicated websiteâ€”a true digital home where your narrative unfolds unadulterated. And with our expertise, this vision is not just possible, but also easily attainable.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 13, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/brad-moore/" rel="author">Brad Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="./another-sample-article.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Another Sample Article </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-10-29T23:45" class="feed__date">October 29, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="./another-sample-article-4.html">A Really Great Story</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
